We approached this hackathon project by considering how the indico.io API could be used to compare opposing viewpoints on various divisive topics. Ultimately, we decided to use indico.io’s “Custom Collections” feature, which allowed us to train a model on for/against arguments from procon.org, as well as various other sources. This let us input text to predict whether it was for or against a given argument.
